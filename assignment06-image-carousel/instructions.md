# Assignment 6: Image Carousel

*Due: Tuesday, October 13, 2020*

This assignment requires you to build an **Image Carousel** app based on a publicly available package: **carousel_slider 2.3.1**

You will need:

- Install: [Carousel Slider Package (on pub.dev)](https://pub.dev/packages/carousel_slider)
  - Then install the package into a new Android Studio project
- Use the file, **starter_code2.txt** from this ZIP file: [Starter Code Snippets x2 (ZIP)](13-image-carousel/starter-code-snippets.zip)
  - Use the snippet in your **main.dart** file and then edit where indicated
  - Remember: you need to edit your **pubspec.yaml** file when using local assets

## Requirements

- Create an app using Android Studio that runs an **Image Carousel**, based on **carousel_slider 2.3.1**, that looks like this and allows users to swipe left and right through a set of pre-selected images

- The images selected for the app must be appropriate for their usage, meaning they have to be relatively small - but not too small - so they load fast and look good
- The images must be installed in the file system with the app and use the **Image.asset()** method to display the images

## Turn it in

Go to the **Assignment 6: Image Carousel** in Blackboard.

- ZIP (compress) the Android Studio project folder that contains the app and attach the ZIP file to the assignment submission
