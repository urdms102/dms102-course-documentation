# Assignment 1: Install Dart & Flutter
*Due: Tuesday, September 1, 2020* 

Your assignment is to install **Flutter**, the framework we'll be using to build applications in DMS 102.  

Note: part of the installation process for Flutter will have you install its dependencies which includes **Dart** and some other required programs depending on whether you're using a Mac or PC, and whether you want to develop apps for Android devices and/or iOS.

- For your reference, the official instructions for installing Flutter from the publisher are here: [Install Instructions from Flutter.dev/docs/getting-started](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install), but they assume you're already a software developer and you have familiarity with working with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and using a CLI (Command Line Interface). So...
- Instead of using those instructions by themselves, I recommend you open that link (above) and then use these tutorials (below) that do a better job of walking you through the process.
- NOTES before you start:
    - Make sure your OS (operating system) is up-to-date!
    - These tutorials are one year old so there is some information and screens that are out of date.  See the "important notes" where indicated
    - The installation process *really does take a long time*, depending on a lot of factors like your connectivity speed and your computer's speed.  Plan accordingly.
- Tutorials:
    - WINDOWS tutorials (parts 1,2,3):<br>

      - [Using Android Studio for Flutter Development - Part 1 - Configuration](https://youtu.be/47keBFllFvQ) (may be good for informational purposes, but probably not useful)
      - [Using Android Studio for Flutter Development - Part 2 - Guided Tour](https://youtu.be/enUdOLgl4Jk) (also probably not useful)

###### Important Notes

\* Since the recording of these videos some of the instructions *may* need to be changed based on the particulars of your operating system.  In the Mac operating system, the name of the file for setting the "PATH" to Flutter (see timestamp: 5:18) *may* need to be different based on the type of "shell" (command line program) you're using.  

- If you're using "Bash" (look in the title bar of the Terminal window), then the instructions in the video are correct
- If you're using "Zsh" (look in the title bar of the Terminal window), then you need to use filename: **.zshrc**, instead of .bash_profile, so you would type: `vim .zshrc` instead.

\** At video timestamp 1:11, the presenter selects *Pie* which is no longer in the *Recommended* list.  That's okay.  Navigate to the "x86 Images" tab and select and download **Pie - API Level 27 - x86_64**
