# Discussion Notes

Here is a list of notes and summaries about what we discussed in the discussion on Tuesday, October 20th.

## DMS 102 Shared Resources

Watch the four tabs in this [Google Sheet: Open Source Flutter Resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9B9kctL961wwVnVgzTvkROltFTi1rKL3NvXwDOovys/edit#gid=747018430) ...and contribute to it!

## Data Persistence

- Learn about [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (specifically, ["Cloud Firestore"](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore))
  - Here is [a good article about Firebase (Medium website)](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/what-is-firebase-the-complete-story-abridged-bcc730c5f2c0)

- Find, try, and share **flutter persistent data tutorials** 
  - When you find a good one, share it in our shared [Open Source Flutter Resources (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9B9kctL961wwVnVgzTvkROltFTi1rKL3NvXwDOovys/edit#gid=311378758)
  - Example: [Firebase for Flutter (Codelabs website)](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase#0)
- Prepare: on Thursday (tomorrow), **Assignment 10: Persistent Data**
  - You will be required to create a new app that uses persistent data
  - You can base the app off of a tutorial ...but you need to alter/repurpose it (change the data it stores; and change the visual styles)

## Final Project

- In prep for writing a **Final Project Proposal** (required for the Final Project), strongly recommended: brainstorm and discuss ideas with the professor and others in DMS 102
  - Be prepared to talk about your ideas tomorrow (Thursday, October 22)
