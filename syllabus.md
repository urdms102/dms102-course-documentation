| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Lab Assignments**  | 35%                       |

## Late assignments

Homework assignments handed in after the deadline without appropriate excuse will receive reduced credit. The maximum possible score on late homework will decrease by 10% for each day late. 

- For example, an assignment which would receive a grade of 85% if handed in on time, would receive a grade of 85% x 90% = 76.5%
- If handed in the next day. The same assignment turned in three days late would receive a grade of 85% x 70% = 59.5%. 
- Following this system, homework handed in 10 or more days late cannot receive a grade higher than 0% and therefore will not be graded. 
- Exceptions to this policy may be made by the TA at the TA's discretion, in response to extenuating circumstances

## Academic Honesty

All assignments and activities associated with this course must be performed in accordance with the [University of Rochester's Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty/). 

You may discuss homework problems with others, but you must not retain written (or photographed) notes from your conversations with other students, or share data via computer files to be used in completing your homework. Your homework must be completed without reference to such notes, with the exception of class and recitation notes, which may be retained in written form. This rule also applies to collaboration between different groups for your group projects. This rule is in place to ensure that you have learned and understand the material based on your discussion and are not simply copying what you were told at critical points in your assignments.

## Attendance

Class attendance and participation is expected. Attendance is not taken and you will notice that there is no attendance component to your grade. However, students that skip lectures will likely have a much more difficult time with quizzes, homework, and the group project. 

##Incompletes

This course follows the [university policy](https://www.rochester.edu/college/ccas/handbook/incompletes.html) regarding incompletes. Incompletes may be given only when there are circumstances beyond the student's control, such as illness or personal emergency, that prevented the student from finishing the coursework on time.

## Absence Due to Illness

The University Health Service does not provide retroactive excuses for missed classes. However, upon request, UHS can provide documentation that the student (you) are (present tense) too ill to attend classes within a certain range of dates, without mention of specifics or the reason for the absence.  

Upon presenting the documentation to the professor, deadlines for assignments may be extended.

Students with extended or severe illness should contact the [College Center for Advising Services](http://www.rochester.edu/college/ccas/) for advice and assistance.
