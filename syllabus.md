## The Virtual Classroom Experience

Each scheduled class session will be of two types: (#1) lecture/demo and (#2) workshop. On lecture/demo days, the instructor will introduce new concepts and walk the students through a step-by-step application of them. Workshop days will begin with the instructor introducing the next assignment and then allowing time for supervised work on that assignment. 

Due to the hands-on nature of the class, comprehensive reading and active participation are not only vital to your grade, but also to your education. 

## Grading

For each assignment, a grading rubric will be provided. Rubrics will inform students how assignments are evaluated.  In the interest of fairness, extra credit and make-up work is not offered.

| Activity                  | Weight of the final grade |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Homework assignments (x8) | 40%                       |
| Projects (x3)             | 30%                       |
| Final Project             | 20%                       |
| Participation             | 10%                       |

## Late assignments

Homework assignments handed in after the deadline without appropriate excuse will receive reduced credit. The maximum possible score on late homework will decrease by 10% for each day late. 

- For example, an assignment which would receive a grade of 85% if handed in on time, would receive a grade of 85% x 90% = 76.5%
- If handed in the next day. The same assignment turned in three days late would receive a grade of 85% x 70% = 59.5%. 
- Following this system, homework handed in 10 or more days late cannot receive a grade higher than 0% and therefore will not be graded. 
- Exceptions to this policy may be made by the professor at the his discretion, in response to extenuating circumstances

## Academic Integrity

Any violation of academic integrity, such as, but not limited to, plagiarism, will not be tolerated. Anyone suspected of plagiarism will be subject to according disciplinary procedures. Plagiarism is the presenting of someone else’s writings or ideas as one’s own. Any ideas, wording, or material taken from another source must be acknowledged and properly documented.
