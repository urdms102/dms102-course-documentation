# Discussion Notes
Here is a list of notes and summaries about what we discussed in last Thursday's project discussion on Thursday, October 15th.

*Regarding the discussion about doing one project versus multiple projects...*

- I've decided to let you guys choose!
- I will come up with a list of requirements - a list of features and functionality that you need to complete before the end of the semester
- How you achieve the list of requirements is up to you:
  - All-in-one app, or...
  - Multiple apps (no more than three)
- The list of requirements will be coming soon (in a week or so) ...I really need to think this through!

## The Final Project

**Project vs Assignment:** going forward, things you turn-in in DMS 102 will either be...

- **Assignment related:** step-by-step demonstrations; just like you've been doing all along (there will be another assignment about storing "persistent data")
- **Project related:** things you turn-in that rely on your own creativity and ability to cobble together new and unique apps

Regarding **project-related work**: even though you may choose to turn-in multiple apps as your Final Project, from here on out I will refer to everything project-related as the "Final Project" (singular) to avoid confusion, even if you decide to turn-in multiple apps.

### What to expect

The list of requirements for the Final Project will be coming soon, but in the meantime here's this:

- At the very least, your final project will need to **demonstrate your ability** to do the following

  - Use *stateful* widgets that change their state based on user input
  - Use images and text
  - Present content using a reasonable amount of styling and layout
  - Use multiple routes (pages)

  ...all in a new/novel app(s) that demonstrate some creativity on your part.

- You will need to actively **contribute to a shared list of open source resources** that will help you and your fellow students build your final project (coming soon)
  - Tutorials (articles and/or YouTube)
  - Packages (see [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/))
  - Open source apps (usually in GitHub)

- You will need to **write-up a proposal** of what you plan to build, and you'll need to turn it in by a certain due date (coming soon)

  - In your proposal you'll need to specify if you plan to deliver one, two, or three apps to fulfill the final requirements

Eventually, there will be a detailed set of instructions and rubric to follow, but in the meantime, here's a high-level view of what kind of grade you can expect:

- **C:** replication of something that already exists with minimal stylistic edits
- **B:** taking an existing app and re-purposing it into a new app
- **A:** taking multiple existing apps, widgets, and/or packages and repurposing them into something completely new and novel

## Starter Websites

Just to help you get thinking, here are some websites that have lots of open source code that you can use for your own Flutter projects.

-	[Open Source Flutter Apps (a listing in GitHub)](https://github.com/tortuvshin/open-source-flutter-apps)

  -	Just a list by someone named Turtuvshin Byambaa
  -	Really well curated
  -	Example: [Flutter Pokedex (GitHub)](https://github.com/scitbiz/flutter_pokedex)

-	[Flutter Awesome (website)](https://flutterawesome.com/)

  -	A huge database of free stuff; looks official

-	[Awesome Open Source (website)](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/flutter)

  -	Lots of free apps and widgets
  -	Example: [Flutter Tetris game (GitHub)](https://github.com/boyan01/flutter-tetris)

Nothing to turn-in at this point, but I suggest you start thinking in terms of:

- What you can do now?
- What do you need to learn or get better with?
- What resources on the Web (or anywhere) can you use to help you along the way?
