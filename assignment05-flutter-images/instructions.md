# Assignment 5: Flutter Images

*Due: Thursday, October 8, 2020*

This assignment requires you to build TWO simple Flutter apps - one in DartPad and one in Android Studio - both of which display images.

## Requirements

- Create an app in **DartPad** that displays an image using the **Image.network()** method to display an image
  - The image selected in the DartPad app must be appropriate for its usage, meaning it has to be relatively small - but not too small - so it loads fast and looks good
  - The app must use a **Scaffold** to load both an *appbar* and body, and the image must display in the body

- Create ANOTHER app using Android Studio that displays an image using the **Image.asset()** method to display an image
  - The image file must be located in a folder named **assets/**
  - The image selected in the Android Studio app must be appropriate for its usage, meaning it has to be relatively small - but not too small - so it loads fast and looks good
  - The app must use a Scaffold to load both an *appbar* and body, and the image must display in the body

## Turn it in

You need to turn in BOTH apps in one Blackboard submission.  Go to the **Assignment 5: Flutter Images** in Blackboard.

- For the DartPad app: turn it into a **DartPad Gist** and paste the URL in the "Write Submission" area (not comments)
  - Don't click the Submit button until you do the next part!

- For the **Android Studio app**: ZIP (compress) the folder that contains the app and attach the ZIP file to the assignment submission
