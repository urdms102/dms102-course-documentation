# DMS 102 Project

The DMS 102 final project is delivered in three parts, described below.  The last part - creation of actual Flutter application - is considered your *final exam* for the course.

**The goal of the project** is to demonstrate your ability to create a **new and novel** phone application using the Flutter framework that meets the basic requirements described in the instructions, below.

## Part 1: Initial Discussion

10% of the final grade for DMS 102

*Initial ideas due: Thursday, November 5*

You must post an idea (at least one) on [our shared Open Source Flutter Resources Google Sheet, on the Tutorials Tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9B9kctL961wwVnVgzTvkROltFTi1rKL3NvXwDOovys/edit#gid=52214594)

- The idea(s) posted is not a commitment, rather just a "conversation starter" that sounds viable and realistic
- Note: you may flex (build upon) other students' ideas (that's the point of sharing the ideas in a place that everyone else can see)
- Each idea must include links to "resources" which can be open source apps or tutorials that are functionally similar, for the purpose of helping to explain the idea and letting others understand the proposed solution
- The links to "resources" should also make it clear how you plan to figure out how to build it (assuming you wouldn't build it from scratch)

## Part 2: Proposal

20% of the final grade for DMS 102

*Proposal due: Thursday, November 12, 2020*

You must turn-in a proposal that describes in detail the application(s) you plan to build.  The proposal must explain the following.

- **PLAN:** do you plan to deliver a single application or multiple apps (up to three) to *fulfill the requirements* of the project?
  - The list of specific requirements, i.e. what the apps must do, functionally, is in the next section, "Application(s)"
  - Note: the proposal must define your *plan* (one, two, or three apps), but you can change your mind later based on what you discover as you work through the development
  - Consider: building a single app might be easier, but building multiple apps will be less risky from a grade perspective
- **DECIDE:** *for whom* is the application intended? Define the expected users of the app in terms of who they would be (demographics), and *what goal(s)* are they trying to achieve by using the app.
- **REPORT:** what is the basis for your ability to create the application?  I.e. what tools and resources will you rely upon to build it?
  - You can use articles, tutorials, open source projects, technical documentation, and/or development tools; whatever you *plan* to use must be cited
  - Note: later, as you work through the development, you may or may not find those tools and resources actually helpful.  You just need a plan at this time.  When you turn-in your actual project you'll need to cite which tools and resources you *actually* used
  - You do not need to list tools and resources we've already covered as part of DMS 102 (e.g. Android Studio); all that is understood already.  Just list the unique things you found that will help you do your development work

Note: the proposal document must follow typical college-level style and formatting norms with things like, title, your name, date, et cetera.  There should be no spelling mistakes, typos, or grammatical errors, and the document should be easy to read and understand.

## Part 3: Application(s)

30% of the final grade for DMS 102

*Application(s) due: Friday, December 18, 2020 (end of finals week)*

You must develop and publish your application(s) that meet the following technical requirements.

The particulars of how requirements are fulfilled must be new and unique - not just simple replication of what was done in some tutorial or open source app on which the application(s) may be based.  

The goal with each requirement listed below is to demonstrate that you understand the code well enough to be able to edit and write parts of it yourself based on what you learned in DMS 102.

### Visual Requirements

- Custom **text and images** (optionally, other media) on **multiple routes** (pages) that work in support of the goal of the application(s) as defined in the proposal
- Reasonable amount of **page layout** and **styling** throughout, demonstrating understanding of:
  - Positioning of elements on a page
  - Typography: font, style, and color
  - Background: image and/or color

...all for the purpose of increasing usability and readability

### Functional Requirements

The following functional requirements must serve a purpose; they must be in support of the stated goal(s) of the application(s)

- Use **stateful widgets** that change their state based on user input

- Ability to use a server-side database (any type) to retain data used by the application(s) and complete *at least two* of the **four basic database functions** (ability to do all four database functions would be best!)

  Note: there are four basic database functions for all apps; they are:

  - Create: the ability to write data (records) to the database
  - Read: the ability to retrieve data from the database and display it to the user
  - Update: the ability to update (change) existing records in the database
  - Delete: the ability to remove existing records in the database

Note: you do not have to use Firebase to complete the database-related functions.  There are other solutions.  

### Other Requirements

- In addition to providing the source files (the project folder) as a ZIP file in Blackboard described in the Turn It In section, below, you must also **create a distributable APK file(s)** to turn-in with your final project

## Turn It In

### Initial Discussion

- 10% of the final grade for DMS 102

- *Initial ideas due: Thursday, November 5*

Simply input ideas into [our shared Open Source Flutter Resources Google Sheet, on the Tutorials Tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9B9kctL961wwVnVgzTvkROltFTi1rKL3NvXwDOovys/edit#gid=52214594); the professor will provide feedback that will indicate if or when you've completed this portion of the project

### Proposal

- 20% of the final grade for DMS 102
- *Proposal due: Thursday, November 12, 2020*

Go to the assignment in Blackboard named: *Final Project Proposal* and summit your proposal.  You may use whatever document format you want.

### Application(s)

Consider this part of the project: your final exam for DMS 102

- 30% of the final grade for DMS 102
- *Application(s) due: Friday, December 18, 2020 (end of finals week)*

Go the assignment in Blackboard named: *Final Project Application(s)* and attach the following:

- A ZIP file of the Android Studio project folder that contains the app (one each)
- The APK file for the application (one each)
- If the final application(s) differs from the previously submitted proposal, there must be another document that describes why there were deviations from the original proposal and what was done instead
