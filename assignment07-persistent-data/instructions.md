# Assignment 7: Persistent Data

*Due: <s>Tuesday, October 27, 2020</s>* Updated: Thursday, October 29, 2020

This assignment requires you to find your own tutorial about [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (specifically, ["Cloud Firestore"](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)), and then create your own Flutter app based on it.

1. Find a good tutorial that explains how to create a Flutter app that reads & writes information to a **Firebase *Cloud Firestore* database**. The tutorial should:
   - Show you how to setup and use Firebase
   - Provide sample code to build a complete app that you can follow along in Android Studio
2. When you have a good tutorial that helps you build a working copy of their demonstration, share the information and link in our [Google Sheet: Open Source Flutter Resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9B9kctL961wwVnVgzTvkROltFTi1rKL3NvXwDOovys/edit#gid=1404322235), in the Tutorials tab
3. Build the app shown in the tutorial and then alter it (repurpose it), meaning: change the data it stores, the labels, and visual styles
   - The amount of change you need to do is somewhat subjective; it doesn't have to be much - it just needs to demonstrate that you understand the code well enough to make edits

## Turn it in

Go to the **Assignment 7: Persistent Data** in Blackboard.

- ZIP (compress) the Android Studio project folder that contains the app and attach the ZIP file to the assignment submission
