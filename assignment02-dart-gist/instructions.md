# Assignment 2: Dart Gist
*Due: Thursday, September 10, 2020* 

Your assignment is to create and turn-in a **DartPad program** via a **GitHub Gist** that demonstrates **all six things that computers can do** AND do it in a way that displays content that *hangs together* and makes sense, i.e. not random pieces of dummy text.

Here is some example output (that you cannot use):

```
My name is Robert.
My cat's name is Zoe.
**************************
Favorite Foods
Zoe likes to eat cat food, and I like to eat sushi.
**************************
Size Comparison
Zoe is about 1.25 feet tall, and I am 6.00 feet tall.
I am taller than Zoe by a factor of 4.8:1.
**************************
Favorite Song
My favorite song is the one about bottles of beer. It goes like this:
99 bottles of beer on the wall...
98 bottles of beer on the wall...
97 bottles of beer on the wall...
...you get the idea
```

The above output can be written in Dart using all six *things that computers can do*.

**Another Requirement:** you must use plenty of comments in your Dart code to explain what's what.

## Turn it in

When your program works without error in DartPad, create a Gist for it and bring it up in DartPad.  Then turn-in the DartPad URL in the **Assignment 2: Dart Gist** in Blackboard.
