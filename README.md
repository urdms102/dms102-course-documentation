## Thursday, November 12, 2020

- Open Lab 
  - The idea going forward is for all of us to focus on the Final Project, so instead of piling-on with lecture videos and assignments, we'll dedicate our Tuesday and Thursday meeting times for "open lab" time when you guys can come and go as you please
  - It'll be first come, first serve. So if you connect to the open Zoom session and I'm working with someone else, you'll have to wait (although I'll check-in with you immediately and see what's going on, but I may not be able to get to specific questions right away)
  - BTW - keep in mind that I *will NOT* debug your code for you. Fixing your own mistakes is part of what you need to learn this semester (although if something jumps out at me I'll let you know). Instead, I will look over whatever you're working on and make suggestions to hopefully point you in the right direction.
  - Join us at **2:00 PM** today: [https://rochester.zoom.us/j/95155140724](https://rochester.zoom.us/j/95155140724) ![:turkey:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/apple-medium/1f983.png)

*Continue work on...*
