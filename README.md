- [Lecture 8: Stateful and Stateless Widgets (Panopto)](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=6d158abe-9260-4cec-839b-ac3d016e0b27)
  - Includes a follow-along demo and [linked video (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/-QRQIKtPTlI?t=661)
  - Note: the follow-along demo does *not* need to be turned-in
- New assignment: **read Chapter 4 in Flutter for Beginners**
  - As always, skim first - look for things that you understand and take notes about them; go back later and find more that you start to understand
  - IMPORTANT: **start coding the "Favor Manager"** (starting on p146) as you read, and remember: the book doesn't use Android Studio ...but we do.  So instead of running Flutter from the command line, find the equivalent operations in Android Studio
